# twitter-thread-formatter
I was looking at the views count of some of my Twitter threads the other day, and apparently 80% of the people only bothered to read the first tweet in the thread. Outrageous! How could they comprehend the profoundness of my thoughts if they can't even read to the end? That's the whole point of the threads, to express things that can't be compressed into 280 characters. And you only read the first tweet?!

Then I was struck with an inspiration: If you won't do me right, then I am going to do something even more outrageous. So I created this little tool to reformat Twitter threads and split their information across all the tweets. This way a lazy person who can't be bothered with reading the whole thing will get nothing out of my tweet.

I tailored this to suit my own writing style (mostly Chinese-English code switching), I may or may not add more features later.

Don't ask me how to use it or where's a convenient exe file for you to download. Read the f*ckin' code.
